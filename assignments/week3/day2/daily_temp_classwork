My approach included: using a stack, pushing the indices onto the stack, and working backwards by starting at the end of the array. One of the reasons why I couldn't implement the solution was because I didn't know what to push onto the stack. After another group drew a visualization and explained that the new array was tip-i, it helped but things into perspective. I probably needed to go over it again before trying it on my own.
