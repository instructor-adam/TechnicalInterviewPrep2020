## Repo Structure

- This README contains your assignments
- The `assignments` folder is where you will put your work when you
  submit a pull request to me. This is also where we will post
  solutions after the classwork/homework should have already been
  done.

## Assignments

Each assignment has the following format:

Date given: description. Due date. Assignment name.

The due date means before class on that date. So if a homework is due
on 6/10, then it is due before 10:00 AM on 6/10.

For any assignment where we ask you to solve a problem, please submit
your program to the github using the directions below under
'submitting HW'.

### Submitting HW

To get setup to submit homework, **fork this repository**.

Then do the following when you do homework:

- Pull from my repository to your fork. There will be files in the
  correct location for the work to do that day. If you are submitting
  homework *due on* 6/5 (not assigned 6/5), for example, which is the
  1st day of the 2nd week of the bootcamp, then you would find the
  file at `week2/day1/assignment-name`. In general, the path for a
  file is `week#/day#/assignment-name`. The same is true for
  submitting classwork we did on 6/5. You would look for the correct
  file under `week2/day1/assignment-name`.
- Do the work.
- When you are ready to start comitting work to your fork, place your
  work in the appropriate file, and change it. Unless I say otherwise,
  you can submit your solutions as Javascript of C++ files. If you
  need to change the file extension of the file, that is fine. Just
  don't change the base name of the file. Example: you can change
  `implement-hash-table.cpp` to `implement-hash-table.js` 
  but not to `hash-tbl.cpp`. 
- Commit your changes, push them to your fork, and then submit a pull
  request from your fork against my repository.

### What if the problem is too hard?

If you are not able to solve the problem at home then post up a
program containing the following:

As comments:

- a description of the approach(es) you thought of
- a description of where you got stuck on these approaches. For
  example:
    - Was there a flaw in the approach you found and you had to think
      of a new one? What was the flaw? How did you try to get around
      it?
    - Were you just unable to implement the approach? Which part(s)
      were you unable to implement, and why?

As code:

- whatever part of a program you wrote if you wrote one

We prefer you submit something that runs, but sometimes we don't get
that far. Whether it runs or not, just submit what you have.
