## Repo Structure

- This README contains your assignments
- The `assignments` folder is where you will put your work when you
  submit a pull request to me. This is also where I will post
  solutions after the classwork/homework should have already been
  done.

## Assignments

Each assignment has the following format:

Date given: description. Due date. Assignment name.

The due date means before class on that date. So if a homework is due
on 1/10, then it is due before 10:00 AM on 1/10.

For any assignment where I ask you to solve a problem, please submit
your program to the github using the directions below under
'submitting HW'.

### Submitting HW

To get setup to submit homework, **fork this repository**.

Then do the following when you do homework:

- Pull from my repository to your fork. There will be files in the
  correct location for the work to do that day. If you are submitting
  homework *due on* 1/5 (not assigned 1/5), for example, which is the
  1st day of the 2nd week of the bootcamp, then you would find the
  file at `week2/day1/assignment-name`. In general, the path for a
  file is `week#/day#/assignment-name`. The same is true for
  submitting classwork we did on 1/5. You would look for the correct
  file under `week2/day1/assignment-name`.
- Do the work.
- When you are ready to start comitting work to your fork, place your
  work in the appropriate file, and change it. Unless I say otherwise,
  you can submit your solutions as Javascript of C++ files. If you
  need to change the file extension of the file, that is fine. Just
  don't change the base name of the file. Example: you can change
  `implement-hash-table.cpp` to `implement-hash-table.js` 
  but not to `hash-tbl.cpp`. 
- Commit your changes, push them to your fork, and then submit a pull
  request from your fork against my repository.

### What if the problem is too hard?

If you are not able to solve the problem at home then post up a
program containing the following:

As comments:

- a description of the approach(es) you thought of
- a description of where you got stuck on these approaches. For
  example:
    - Was there a flaw in the approach you found and you had to think
      of a new one? What was the flaw? How did you try to get around
      it?
    - Were you just unable to implement the approach? Which part(s)
      were you unable to implement, and why?

As code:

- whatever part of a program you wrote if you wrote one

I prefer you submit something that runs, but sometimes we don't get
that far. Whether it runs or not, just submit what you have.
